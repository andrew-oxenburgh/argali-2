## Argali 

A swipe in swipe out app.

### Raison d'Etre

Learning https://aurelia.io/


### Use Case

A cafe has people working there, and we wish to know when they start and finish.

This is a re-write of a previous incarnation found here:  https://andrew-oxenburgh.github.io/argali/. 

This is more of an exercise in `Aurelia`


### How to use: 

Click on a user to start work. Click on a user to stop work.

There are 2 pages: Staff Page, and Report Page.

### Aims:

 - Don't use jQuery. It is not recommended to mix Shadow DOM frameworks and jQuery, so try to use it minimally.

### To do:

 - Tests 
 - external persistence - currently it's just web `localStorage`
 - Authentication - possibly Googles `firebase`
 - actual drag and drop
 - notifications
